    <div id="title"><h1>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</h1></div>

 	<section>
     	<h2>Status of this Memo</h2>
     	<p>
     		This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
   			IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
   			useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
   			recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

    	<h2>Overview and Rational</h2>
     	<p>
     		Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
		    altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
		    point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
		    but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
 		    each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
 		    space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
		    IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
		    system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
		    technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
		    line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
		    some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
     	</p>
     	<h2>Frame Format</h2>
     	<p>
     		The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
		    hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
		    The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
		    A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
		    bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
		    paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
		    typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
		    datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
		    form.
     	</p>
     	<h2>Discussion</h2>
     	<p>
     		Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
		    order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
		    eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
		    of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-
		    regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause
		    data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier
		    drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be
		    found on logs and cable trays.
     	</p>

    	<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
     	<p>
     		Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
		    measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
		    are used in a tactical environment.
