     		This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
		    community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
		    Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
		    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

     	<h2>Abstract</h2>
     	<p>
     		This memo amends <a href="rfc1149.html">RFC 1149</a>, "A Standard for the Transmission of IP
		    Datagrams on Avian Carriers", with Quality of Service information.
		    This is an experimental, not recommended standard.

    	<h2>Overview and Rational</h2>
    	<p>
    		The following quality of service levels are available: Concorde,
		    First, Business, and Coach.  Concorde class offers expedited data
		    delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is
		    the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus
		    the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per
		    packet.  Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater
		    bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the
		    use of bridges between domains.
    	
    		The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code
		    markings on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code
		    reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue
		    it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time.
		    The carriers may sleep while enqueued.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.
		    Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.
		    Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers
		    as Prime.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.
    		Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as
			shown:

    	<p>
    		Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out
		    worm hole tunnels.  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may
		    digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.
		    The carriers may be confused by mirrors.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned
			networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed
		    entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think
		    MPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have
		    been met with resistance.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying
		    the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY
		    eat the NATs.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional
		    encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation
		    being messy and the packets mangled.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced
		    standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source
		    routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding
				technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone
		    device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is
		    being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The
		    carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding
		    ring searches is limited.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's
				guide.

    	<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
     	<p>
     		Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
		    measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
		    are used in a tactical environment.

    		The carriers will not line up in lexigraphic order but will
		    naturally order in a large V shape.  Bulk retrieval is possible
		    using the Powerful Get-Net operator.

    	<h2>Specification of Requirements</h2>
    	<p>
    		In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
		    of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

		    MUST      Usually.

		    MUST NOT  Usually not.

		    SHOULD    Only when Marketing insists.

		    MAY       Only if it doesn't cost extra.

    	<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
     	<p>
     		There are privacy issues with stool pigeons.
			Agoraphobic carriers are very insecure in operation.
     	</p>
     	<h2>Patent Considerations</h2>
     	<p>
     		There is ongoing litigation about which is the prior art: carrier or
			egg.
